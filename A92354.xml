            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 62 -->part of my wonder, that men (whom I thought heretofore di≈øcreet, any moderate) ≈øhould have undertaken this imployment, and that ≈øince the-came (I having delivered them the An≈øwer: you have heard, and comd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded them to returne per≈øonally with it to the Parliament) ≈øhould have flatly di≈øobeyed mee upon pretence of the Parliaments command. My end in telling you this, is to warne you of them, for ≈øince the≈øe men have brought me ≈øuch a Me≈ø≈øage, and di≈øobeyed ≈øo lawfull a Command, I will not ≈øay what their intent of ≈øtaying here is, onely I bid you take heed, not knowing what doctrine of di≈øobedience they may preach to you, under colour of obeying the Parliament. Hitherto I have found and kept you quiet, the enjoying of which was a chiefe cau≈øe of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither (Tumults and di≈øorders having made me leave the South) and not to make this a ≈øeate of Warre, as malice would (but I hope in vain) make you beleeve; Now if di≈øturbances do come, I know whom I have rea≈øon to ≈øu≈øpect.</p>
            <p>To be ≈øhort, you ≈øee that my Magazine is going to be taken from me (being my owne proper goods) directly again≈øt my will; The <hi>Militia</hi> (again≈øt Law and my con≈øent) is going to be put in Execution: And la≈øtly, Sir <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> Trea≈øon is countenanced; All this con≈øidered none can blame me to apprehend dangers.

And for this purpo≈øe they are already upon framing their humble de≈øires to his Maje≈øty, wherein they ≈øhall reque≈øt ≈øuch things as they conceive doe chiefely tend the honour of God, the greatne≈ø≈øe and pro≈øperity of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øtie, and the publike good of this Common-wealth, the≈øe were almo≈øt perfected before the receipt of your Petition, and will very ≈øpeedily be to the King, which had beene done ere this, but that his Maje≈øty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing him≈øelfe ≈øo farre from the Parliament, and tho≈øe many denyalls, they have had in tho≈øe things they have de≈øired, have nece≈ø≈øitated them to ≈øpend much of their time in Me≈ø≈øages, and diverted them from their other more nece≈ø≈øary bu≈øine≈ø≈øes, but they doubt not but in the≈øe de≈øires they will make ≈øuch cleare demon≈øtrations of their duty to the King, and love to his people, who have intru≈øted them, that they ≈øhall fully acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves thereof, both to him and them. Sir, this is what at this time I am commanded to write to you, onely adding, that I am, &amp;c.</p>
